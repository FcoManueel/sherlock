# Sherlock
Sherlock is a Machine Learning powered tool to derive insights about potential issues down the road in a software project.  
Sherlock has learned from historical data from millions of repositories, and uses that data to make sofisticated predictions and analysis about your code.

All you need is a public GitHub repository with a sizeable commit history.
